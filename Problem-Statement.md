# Dead-Reckoning 

Ethan Hunt is on a mission to retrieve a key which unlocks a deadly weapon launching in T-Minus 5 minutes. However, the key is guarded by a firewall known as the Entity, which displays a sequence cypher containing the digits **a_i** where (0 <= **a_i** <= 3) which has to be cracked in order to disable it. Benji (Hunt's friend) figures out that the sequence has to be reduced such that the final sequence contains alternating digits and the solution to the cypher is the minimum number of digits to be reduced in the original sequence in order to make it an alternating sequence. (Check test cases for more clarity.) Assume the answer always exists.

# Input
Number **N** ranging from 2 <= **N** <= 10^6 and the sequence of length **N** . 

# Output 
Output a single integer which is the minimum number of digits to be removed such that an alternating sequence is obtained .
