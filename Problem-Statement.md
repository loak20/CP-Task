# Dead-Reckoning 
Ethan Hunt is on a mission to retrieve a key which unlocks a deadly weapon launching in T-Minus 5 minutes . However the key is guarded by a firewall known as the Entity , which displays a sequence cypher containing the digits ai where (0<=ai<=3) which has to be cracked inorder to disable it . Benji (Hunt's friend) figures out that the sequence has to be reduced such that the final sequence contains alternating digits and the solution to the cypher is the minimum number of digits to be reduced in the original sequence inorder to make it an alternating sequence . (Check test cases for more clarity) . Assume answer always exists . 

# Input
Enter the sequence where the length of the sequence N ranges from 2<= N < =10^5 . 

# Output 
Output a single integer which is the minimum number of digits to be removed such that an alternating sequence is obtained .
